<h1>Overview</h1>

<p>This document describes how to check out the ArchStudio (and
	constituent) code from GitHub and build ArchStudio from source.</p>

<p>Casual ArchStudio users or those evaluating the technology should
	probably just <a href="setup-easy.html">download and install the
		latest pre-built release</a>. However, ArchStudio developers - those
	who are interested in developing new ArchStudio components, making changes
	to ArchStudio itself, or those interested in having bleeding-edge
	updates to ArchStudio before they go into official release - should
	check out the ArchStudio source code and build the environment from
	source.</p>

<h1>The Source Code Environment</h1>

<p>ArchStudio is built in and for the <a target="_blank"
		href="http://www.eclipse.org/">Eclipse</a> development environment.
	Because it uses plug-ins in Eclipse to auto generate code, it must be
	developed in the Eclipse environment. </p>

<p>If you are just interested in browsing the source without checking it
	out, you can <a target="_blank"
		href="https://github.com/isr-uci-edu/ArchStudio5">browse the raw
		source on GitHub</a>.</p>

<h1>What You'll Need</h1>

<p>You will need the following installed on your machine:</p>
<ul>
	<li><a target="_blank" 
			href="http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html">
	    Java SE 8 SDK</a>*, and</li>
	<li><a target="_blank" 
			href="http://download.eclipse.org/eclipse/downloads/">
	    Eclipse 4.5</a>* or later.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>* ArchStudio can also be compiled and run using Java SE 7
	and Eclipse 4.3 or 4.4. However, it is not, by default, configured
	in this way. To user either of these alternatives, a few minor
	modifications must be made to Eclipse after checkout. These are discussed
	below, in 
	<a href="#java_version">Using a Different Java Virtual Machine</a>.
	</blockquote>

<p>Within Eclipse, you will need to install the following features:</p>
<ul>
	<li>ArchStudio (follow the instructions, <a href="setup-easy.html">
		here</a>),</li>
	<li>Collaboration / Eclipse Git Team Provider,</li>
	<li>General Purpose Tools / Xtext Complete SDK*,</li>
	<li>Modeling / EMF - Eclipse Modeling Framework - SDK*, and</li>
	<li>Modeling / XSD - XML Schema Definition SDK*.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>* These components should be installed automatically when you install 
	ArchStudio in Eclipse. However, if you run into compile errors, try
	installing them manually.</blockquote>

<p>Installing the above Eclipse features is similar to installing ArchStudio
	itself, as described <a href="setup-easy.html">here</a>. However, for the
	"Work with:" field select "--All Available Sites--". Then navigate to 
	and select each feature listed above.</p>
	  
<h1>Checking Out Source Code</h1>

<p>Once you have the tools above installed and running, you can
	check out the ArchStudio source code. ArchStudio is composed of a
	number of different plug-ins, each of which contributes a part to
	the environment.</p>

<p>To check out the code perform the following steps:</p>
<ol>
	<li>Switch to the Git perspective by going to Window | Perspective | Open
		Perspective | Other... | Select "Git" | Hit OK.</li>
	<li>Select "Clone a Git Repository".</li>
	<li>In the Source Git Repository dialog box that pops up, 
		enter the following for the URI field: 
		<a target="_blank"
				href="https://github.com/isr-uci-edu/ArchStudio5.git">
						https://github.com/isr-uci-edu/ArchStudio5.git</a>.</li>
	<li>Click Next to go to Branch Selection page.</li>
	<li>Ensure that "master" is selected.</li>
	<li>Click Next again to go to the Local Destination page.</li>
	<li>Select "Import all existing projects after clone finishes".</li>
	<li>Click Finish.</li>
</ol>
<p>The checkout may take several minutes. After it is completed, you will
	want to return to the Plug-in perspective. To do this:</p>
<ol>
	<li>Switch to the Plug-in perspective by going to Window | Perspective | 
		Open Perspective | Other... | Select "Plug-in Development" | 
		Hit OK.</li>
</ol>

<p>After completing the steps above, you should have the Eclipse
	environment populated with the many plug-ins used to develop ArchStudio.
	All plug-ins should compile without errors except for the
	<code>org.archstudio.releng(.*)</code> plug-ins. These plug-ins are
	used for building and deploying ArchStudio headlessly. You can safely
	close them; they are not required for developing ArchStudio.</p>

<h1>Common Problems</h1>

<h2>Running Eclipse 4.5</h2>
<p>If you get an error running Eclipse having to do with the Java virtual 
	machine not being available, run eclipse using the "-vm" option to 
	indicate the path to the java executable you installed. For instance, 
	if you installed Java 8u45 SDK on a Mac, you would use the following
	command:</p>
<p><code>eclipse -vm /Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/jdk1.8.0_45.jdk/Contents/Home/bin/java</code>
</p>

<h2><a name="java_version" id="java_version">Using a Different Java Virtual Machine</a></h2>
<p>You may elect to use a different version of Java or Eclipse, or your system
	may only have a specific version installed. In such situations you may 
	encounter one or more of the following errors:
	<ul>
		<li>The "Debug" or "Run" buttons are disabled when trying to start
		    ArchStudio (see below).</li>
		<li>ArchStudio starts but immediately exits.</li>
		<li>A <code>java.lang.UnsupportedClassVersionError</code> exception
			is thrown when starting or running ArchStudio.</li>
	</ul>
	These errors indicate that the version of Java being used to compile
	ArchStudio is different from the version of Java being used to run
	ArchStudio. To remedy this:
	<ol>
		<li><b>Register your Java installation with Eclipse.</b> Go to 
			Eclipse Preferences | Java / Installed JREs, and add it if it is
			not already listed.</li>
		<li><b>Set the execution environment to point to your Java 
			installation.</b> Go to Eclipse Preferences | Java / Installed JREs 
			/ Execution Environments, and select your Java installation
			for the appropriate execution environment. For example, if you 
			were to install Java 7u79 SDK, you would select the "JavaSE-1.7" 
			execution environment and check the "Java SE 7 [1.7.0_79]" 
			compatible JRE entry.
		<li><b>Set the Java compiler compliance level.</b> Go to Eclipse 
			Preferences | Java / Compiler, and set the compiler compliance 
			level match your Java installation. For example, if you were to 
			install Java 7u79 SDK, you would select a compiler compliance level 
			of 1.7.</li>
		<li><b>Set the execution environment for the ArchStudio launch 
			configuration (used below).</b> Go to Run | Debug Configurations...
			| Eclipse Application / ArchStudio, and on the Main tab, under 
			Java Runtime Environment, select the execution environment that 
			you configured above.</li>
	</ol>
	After configuring the Eclipse Java settings, you will need to do a clean
	and rebuild, as described below.
</p>

<h2>Clean and Rebuild ArchStudio</h2>
<p>At times Eclipse will report compile errors even though none
	really exist and all projects are checked out. To remedy this, clean and
	rebuild ArchStudion by doing the following:</p>
<ol>
	<li>Go to Project | Clean...</li>
	<li>Select "Clean all projects".</li>
	<li>Hit OK.</li>
</ol>
<p>You may have to repeat this step twice.</p>

<h1>Running ArchStudio</h1>

<p>From within Eclipse, you can run the version of ArchStudio that
	you checked out using the ArchStudio launch configuration. To do so,
	perform the following:</p>
<ol>
	<li>Go to Run | Debug Configurations...</li>
	<li>Select Eclipse Applications / ArchStudio.</li>
	<li>Click Debug.</li>
	<li>(If "Debug" is disable, look at 
		<a href="#java_version">Using a Different Java Virtual Machine</a>, above.)</li>
	<li>(You may get a dialog box asking if Eclipse may accept incoming 
		network connections. If so, click "Allow" in order for the Eclipse
		debugger to interact with ArchStudio.)</li>
</ol>
<p>Now that you have a running version of ArchStudio, take a look at 
	<a href="getting-started.html">getting started with an architecture</a>.</p>
