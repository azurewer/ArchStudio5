<h1>Easy Setup Overview</h1>

<p>This document explains the procedures necessary to download and
	install ArchStudio. ArchStudio has three critical components:</p>

<ol>
	<li><a target="_blank" 
			href="http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html">
	    Java SE 8 SDK</a>*, and</li>
	<li><a target="_blank" 
			href="http://download.eclipse.org/eclipse/downloads/">
	    Eclipse 4.5</a>* or later.</li>
	<li>ArchStudio itself.</li>
</ol>
<blockquote>* Currently, ArchStudio can also be run using the Java SE 7 SDK 
and Eclipse 4.3, but this is not recommended.</blockquote>

<p>If you already have the Java SE 8 SDK or Eclipse 4.5 installed, you may 
	safely skip those parts of these instructions as they require no special 
	configuration for ArchStudio.</p>

<h2>Step 1: Setting up Java SE 8 SDK</h2>
<p>It is possible that you already have Java 8 installed on your machine. 
	To check, start a command-prompt and run:</p>
<p>
	<code>java -version</code>
</p>
<p>If the version reported is (1.)8.0 or better, skip to the next step. If
	not, you will need to obtain a version of Java for your target environment. 
	In general, you can obtain such a release free of charge from Oracle at the
	<a target="_blank"
		href="http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html">
		Java SE Downloads</a> site. This is generally the path to pursue.
</p>
<p>Linux users may also want to investigate how Java is deployed on their
	particular distribution of Linux. Many distributions offer
	Java through their package repositories such as	<code>apt</code>.
</p>

<h2>Step 2: Setting up Eclipse</h2>
<p>ArchStudio requires Eclipse 4.5. If you already have Eclipse installed, 
	you may install ArchStudio into your existing environment and can skip to 
	the next step. Alternatively, you can simply duplicate your Eclipse 
	directory or download and extract another copy to create a copy of Eclipse 
	solely for running ArchStudio.</p>
<p>Download Eclipse 4.5 from the 
	<a target="_blank"
		href="http://download.eclipse.org/eclipse/downloads/">
		Eclipse downloads site</a>.
	Eclipse's site should provide adequate documentation for expanding the
	archive and starting the Eclipse environment.
	</p>
<p>When starting Eclipse, it may ask you for a workspace location. This is the
	directory where Eclipse will store projects, including ArchStudio projects
	that contain xADL files. You may accept the default or choose a different
	directory. We recommend creating a new directory outside of Eclipse's 
	install directory, since this makes it easier to upgrade Eclipse later 
	without having to go through extra trouble to migrate your workspace to 
	the new version.
</p>
<p>Once Eclipse is running, it may show the Welcome view if this is
	the first time it has been run. Close the Welcome view and the Java
	development perspective should be displayed.</p>

<h2>Step 3: Installing ArchStudio</h2>
<p>The following steps walk you through the install of ArchStudio.
	Note that you must be connected to the Internet for this to work.</p>
<table>
	<tr><td><a href="images/archstudio-install.png"><img
				src="images/archstudio-install.png" alt="Available Software Dialog"
				width="200px" /></a></td>
		<td><p>To install ArchStudio perform the following steps:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Go to Help | Install New Software... to open the Available
					Software dialog box.</li>
				<li>In the "Work with:" text box (as highlighted on the left)
					enter the following URL: <a target="_blank"
					href="http://www.isr.uci.edu/projects/archstudio-5/updatesite-4.3">
					http://www.isr.uci.edu/projects/archstudio-5/updatesite-4.3</a>
				</li>
				<li>Press Enter and wait for Eclipse to display entries in the 
					table below the "Work With" text box.</li>
				<li>Select "ArchStudio" (as highlighted on the left).</li>
				<li>Hit "Next" to go to the Install Details page.</li>
				<li>Hit "Next" again to go to the Review Licenses page.</li>
				<li>Select "I accept the terms of the license agreement(s)".
					</li>
				<li>Hit "Finish".</li>
			</ol>
		</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td><a href="images/archstudio-install2.png"><img
				src="images/archstudio-install2.png" alt="Security Warning"
				width="200px" /></a></td>
		<td><p>Eventually, a security warning will appear, as shown
				on the left. Hit "OK".</p></td>
	</tr>
</table>
<p>Installation of ArchStudio may take several minutes. When finished, you will
	be prompted to restart Eclipse. Hit "Yes".


<h1>Using ArchStudio</h1>

<p>Once ArchStudio is installed, proceed to the 
	<a href="getting-started.html">getting started with an architecture</a>.</p>

<h1>Updating ArchStudio</h1>

<p>Updates to ArchStudio are also deployed through the ArchStudio update site 
	and are available through Eclipse's plug-in update mechanisms. To perform 
	an update, do the following:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Go to Help | Check for Updates</li>
</ul>
