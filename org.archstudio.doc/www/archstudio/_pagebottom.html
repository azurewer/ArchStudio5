	<script type="text/javascript" src="emailProtector.js"></script>


	<!-- This script block stores your encrypted email address(es) in -->
	<!-- the addresses array.  If you ever want to add new addresses to -->
	<!-- a page, you can return to http://www.jracademy.com/~jtucek/email/ -->
	<!-- and generate more, and then add this block to your existing page. -->

	<!-- Here are some examples of how to display protected email address     -->
	<!-- links.  If you entered more than one address, take note that each    -->
	<!-- one is referenced by a different number, ranging from zero on up.    -->
	<!-- Otherwise, you leave the number zero in the function call, and it    -->
	<!-- will give you the first email address you entered.                   -->


	<!-- A clickable link without your email address in the text.             -->
	<!-- This is slightly more secure than the previous two, since            -->
	<!-- the user has to click the link before your email address             -->
	<!-- is ever decrypted.                                                   -->
