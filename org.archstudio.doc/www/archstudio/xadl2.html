<h1>xADL - the Modeling Language Behind ArchStudio</h1>

<p>Software and system architectures are represented in architecture
	description languages (ADLs). Many ADLs have been proposed and
	developed over the past decade, including Acme, Darwin, C2SADEL, and
	Rapide. These languages allow users to document design decisions that
	make up an architecture.</p>

<p>
	For ArchStudio, we developed an XML-based ADL. This ADL is defined in a
	set of <a target="_blank" href="http://www.w3.org/tr/xmlschema-0/">XML
		Schemas</a>. Collectively, this set of XML schemas is called xADL. Unlike
	many other ADLs, xADL can be extended by adding new schemas. As such,
	any architecture-related information can be stored in xADL. In
	ArchStudio, all information about a software architecture is stored in
	xADL. ArchStudio component developers are discouraged from using or
	developing their own file formats. Keeping the architecture description
	entirely in xADL ensures that all tools can access it via a common
	interface, the component <a href="xarchadt.html">xArchADT</a>.
</p>

<p>
	xADL has its own website. The xADL website is: <a
