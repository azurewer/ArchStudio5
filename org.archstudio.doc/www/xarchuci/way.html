<h1>The xADL Way</h1>

<p>The past ten to fifteen years of software and systems
	architecture research have created a huge number of (largely
	incompatible) architecture description languages - notations for
	writing down architectures. It is easy to get entranced with the idea
	that the best concepts from all these languages could be combined into
	a single "super ADL" that was adequate for all domains and projects.
<p>
	However, architecture is a broad concept, and each project/domain's
	notion of what an architecture is and what sorts of data it should
	contain is different (and rightly so!) Furthermore, the purpose of an
	architecture description is largely driven by project stakeholders and
	their needs. Thus, <i>no one ADL will ever fit all projects or
		domains</i>.
<p>
	xADL's strength is <b>not</b> that it includes modeling features
	suitable for every potential project. In fact; where methodologies
	disagree or diverge, xADL tends to take a neutral approach, not
	advocating or encoding one set of concepts over another. xADL's primary
	strength is its <i>extensibility</i>&mdash;it can <b>act as the
		basis for the rapid development of domain/project-specific ADLs</b>.
<h2>Using xADL in Your Project</h2>

<p>Using xADL in a project means integrating it into a development
	process. Because of the diversity of projects and needs, it's unlikely
	that xADL (or any other ADL or notation) will support all your needs
	right off the bat (although, as xADL and its tool support grows, this
	may change).
<p>
	Unlike other notations, xADL's syntax and tools were <i>meant</i> to be
	extended to support project-specific needs. The process by which this
	is done is roughly as follows:
<ol>
	<li>Identify discrepancies between what xADL can model in its set
		of provided schemas and what you want to model for your project.
	<li>Decide which xADL elements to extend to support your new
		modeling needs&mdash;do you need to add new kinds of data to
		structural elements like components and connectors? Their types? Or do
		you need new kinds of elements altogether?
	<li>Decide how to syntactically encode these new extensions or
		elements.
	<li>Write new XML schemas extending xADL to add your new modeling
		constructs. Validate your new schemas with a tool like <a
		target="_blank" href="http://www.w3.org/2001/03/webdata/xsv">XSV</a>.
	
	<li>Run <a href="tools-apigen.html">Apigen</a> to generate a new
		data binding library that includes your extensions.
	<li>Use syntax-based tools like <a target="_blank"
		href="http://www.isr.uci.edu/projects/archstudio/">ArchStudio's</a> <a
		target="_blank"
		href="http://www.isr.uci.edu/projects/archstudio/archedit.html">ArchEdit</a>
		to extend existing architecture descriptions with new kinds of data in
		the format you specified.
	<li>Extend semantics based tools like <a target="_blank"
		href="http://www.isr.uci.edu/projects/archstudio/">ArchStudio's</a> <a
		target="_blank"
		href="http://www.isr.uci.edu/projects/archstudio/archipelago-overview.html">Archipelago</a>
		to provide friendlier editors and analysis tools for your new
		notational extensions.
</ol>

<p>The xADL language itself is built and evolved in precisely this
	way. Over time, ArchStudio's tool sets have evolved to better support
	these extensions, and many ArchStudio tools (like Archipelago) are
	built in very modular ways to make extending them to support new
	schemas as easy as possible.</p>

<h2>Why not arbitrary name-value pair properties?</h2>

<p>We get this question often enough that it warrants having a
	section on this page. Many xADL users find the above extension process
	somewhat cumbersome and ask for extensions that decorate some (or all)
	xADL elements with arbitrary name-value pair properties (or,
	alternatively, name-type-value tuples).
<p>While this would indeed make it relatively easy to slip new data
	into an architecture description, we've repeatedly rejected this
	suggestion for a number of reasons. Allowing arbitrary properties means
	forfeiting the rigor provided by having a well-defined language syntax.
	xADL's syntax is designed to be rigorous but not formal. Losing this
	rigor means:
<ul>
	<li><b>(Uncontrolled) Language Fragmentation:</b> Allowing any
		user to insert arbitrary data into xADL documents means that each user
		will potentially have their own 'xADL dialect' that is undocumented
		and will likely be incompatible (in subtle ways) with others' xADL
		dialects.
	<li><b>Inability to validate properties:</b> XML schema-based
		validators can check xADL documents for syntactic correctness, but
		only if schemas are present. Properties allow users to subvert even
		simple syntax validators.
	<li><b>Loss of syntax-directed tools</b>: Apigen and ArchEdit are
		powerful examples of how syntax-directed tools can add value to an
		architecture-driven development environment. However, these tools can
		provide little or no additional value and guidance if all they know is
		that an element has properties with charcter string names and values.



	
	<li><b>Encourages encodings-within-encodings and overloading</b>:
		The presence of arbitrary properties makes it very tempting to add
		structured data as character string property values; a job that is
		much better handled by encoding that structured data in XML elements
		and attributes. Already we see this problem occurring with xADL's
		descriptive elements like Descriptions, which have been variously
		overloaded to have additional semantics beyond their intended use.
		This invariably leads to fragility in tools and document portability
		and maintenance problems.
</ul>

<p>
	Of course, in keeping with the xADL notion that no one set of concepts
	fits all, it is still perfectly legal to extend xADL with your own
	property-based extensions and tools if you like. However, for the
	reasons outlined above, we strongly advocate a more careful examination
	of your modeling needs to decide (and codify) exactly what new data
	you're interested in adding to your architecture descriptions.
