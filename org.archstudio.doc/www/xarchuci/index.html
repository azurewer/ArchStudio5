<h1>Welcome to the xADL Homepage!</h1>

<p>
	Welcome to the xADL homepage! xADL is an <a target="_blank"
		href="http://www.isr.uci.edu/architecture/">architecture</a>
	description language (ADL) for software and systems developed by the <a
		target="_blank" href="http://www.isr.uci.edu/">Institute for
		Software Research</a> at the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.uci.edu">University
		of California, Irvine</a>.
<p>This is where you can find all of UCI's latest enhancements and
	tools for the xADL software and systems architecture description
	language (see below for description).
<p>
	If you're a software or systems engineer visiting this site for the
	first time, you've probably got your own ideas about architecture
	description notations. We've added a page covering how xADL is
	different from other ADLs and how to use it in your own projects called
	<a href="way.html">"The xADL Way"</a>.
<p>
	<b>The xADL language itself is not bound to any particular
		architectural style, tool set, or methodology</b>. xADL and tools such as
	<a href="tools-apigen.html">Apigen</a> and the <a href="tools-dbl.html">xArch/xADL
		Data Binding Library</a> can be used by themselves, independent of any
	particular development environment or domain. However, we have
	integrated many more advanced xADL tools in the <a target="_blank"
		href="http://www.isr.uci.edu/projects/archstudio/">ArchStudio
		Architecture-centric Development Environment</a>. Most users interested in
	working with xADL will want to download and use ArchStudio as well as
	the basic xADL tools.
<h1>What is xADL?</h1>
<p>
	xADL is a software architecture description language (ADL) developed by
	the University of California, Irvine for modeling the architecture of
	software systems. Unlike many other ADLs, xADL is defined as a set of <a
		target="_blank""http://www.w3.org/XML/Schema">XML schemas</a>. This
	gives xADL unprecedented extensibility and flexibility, as well as
	basic support from the many available commercial XML tools.
<p>The current set of xADL schemas includes modeling support for:
<ul>
	<li>run-time and design-time elements of a system;
	<li>support for architectural types;
	<li>advanced configuration management concepts such as versions,
		options, and variants;
	<li>product family architectures; and
	<li>architecture "diff"ing (initial support).
</ul>

<p>We plan to extend this set as our research interests evolve.
	Users of xADL are free to choose elements from this set or create their
	own extensions as needed.
<p>
	xADL is also an application of <a target="_blank"
		href="http://www.isr.uci.edu/projects/xarch/">xArch</a>, a core XML
	schema defined jointly by UCI and Carnegie Mellon University. More
	information about xArch can be found in the next section.
<h1>What is xArch?</h1>
<p>
	<i>From the <a target="_blank"
		href="http://www.isr.uci.edu/projects/xarch/">main xArch webpage</a>:
	</i>
<p>xArch is a standard, extensible XML-based representation for
	software architectures. xArch provides a common core XML notation for
	architectures that can serve:
<ul>
	<li>as a simple stand-alone representation for architectures.
		Specifically, xArch provides a common set of bare-bones features that
		can be used to model an architecture.
	<li>as a starting point for other, more advanced XML-based
		architectural notations. Specifically, the common core can be reused
		while support for other, more advanced ADLs (e.g., Acme, C2SADEL,
		Rapide) can be added through the creation of XML namespace extensions.

	
	<li>as an interchange mechanism for architectural descriptions.
		Specifically, translators can be built to and from the XML notation.
</ul>

<h1>Previous Versions of xADL</h1>

	are available:</p>
